# CpuSsim
A basic Intel 8086 CPU simulator.

Based on the course **Computer, Enhance!** by Casey Muratori. 

Every commit will be a new lesson. So the first, commit will be lesson 1.
The idea is to make the code for every lesson and put it here as a form of documenting my progress and,
at the same time, to serve as a code repository.
It also allow to follow my way of thinking by getting the differences between commits.

I will try to make everything, from documentation to code comments, both in english and portuguese.

### How to run
Clone the repo and run it in Visual Studio or any other editor/IDE of preference.
It is simple dotnet 6 console application.

### How to use it
Once compiled, simply type `cpusim` to show the usage message (it can be different for each commit) and read the instructions.

## 1st Lesson: Instruction Decoding on the 8086
In this lesson we will learn how to decode the instructions of the 8086 CPU. 
We will use the following instructions:
`MOV` register to register.

It is one of the simplest instructions to decode, making it a good introduction on how the CPU works.
